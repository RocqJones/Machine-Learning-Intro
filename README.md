**Machine learning** is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

## Three types of machine learning:

### 1. Supervised learning.
### 2. Unsupervised learning.
### 3. Reinforcement learning.

## [scikit-learn library](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
**Scikit-learn** (formerly scikits.learn and also known as sklearn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification; 
* regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines,
* random forests, 
* gradient boosting, 
* k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to *interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.
    - To install do: ```$ pip install -U scikit-learn```
    - Confirm installation with the following:
      ```
      python -m pip show scikit-learn
      python3 -c "import sklearn; sklearn.show_versions()"
      ```
